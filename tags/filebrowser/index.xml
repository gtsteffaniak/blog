>porting the typscript compiler to go&lt;/a>! This is exciting for many reasons but also surprising for many other reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll address the central question right from the start - &lt;em>Why go instead of other languages&lt;/em>? Because go easily allows them to do a &lt;em>port&lt;/em> of typescript code vs a complete re-write. So, backwards compatibility and the timeline for release is much improved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using go makes sense to me: it&amp;rsquo;s a fast, lightweight, proven language that has all the necessary type features needed for the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, in this article, I want to explain my thoughts on typescript and give some of my opinions on typescript in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-improving-the-typescript-compiler-matters---a-lot">Why improving the typescript compiler matters - a lot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nobody likes waiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have always been hesitant to embrace typescript for my projects. I am fully aware of the benefits of using typescript, but it also has cons that need to be weighed. Many of my projects have very minimal and lightweight frontends. So much so, that I have often opted not to use any framework to build them and use vanilla javascript. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right - vanilla javascript. For a very simple reason: I want my build process to be &lt;strong>blazingly fast&lt;/strong>. I highly value and prioritize faster developer feedback in the form of fast compile times (one reason I love go!). For a small project, I think the value of fast feedback for changes outweighs the type safety benefits of typescript.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The moment you include typescript, you need a framework, and your project suddenly balloons in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If your project&amp;rsquo;s goal is fast and minimal, typescript is at odds. It needs a typescript-compatible framework to be useful. Otherwise, you have to use the typescript compiler on its own and essentially build your framework around the compiler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this in mind, typescript compilation becomes an unfortunate bottleneck in the process. Compling typescript code to javascript increases build time significantly. So, if Microsoft is able to solve the problem, that solves half my issue with typescript.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compile-time-challenges">Compile time challenges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let me put this into perspective with a real-world example. I maintain a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>fork&lt;/a> of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>filebrowser repository&lt;/a> that is vastly different and superior in many ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of those ways: &lt;strong>compile time&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the original repo moved to Vue 3, they also converted most of the javascript to TypeScript- a choice I mostly avoided. This was intentional - because I noticed typscript significantly slowed down build times, I chose to keep the javascript versions mostly the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much slower was it? Well, see for yourself:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">✓ built in 19.12s
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">✓ built in 1.83s
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong>more than 10x improvement&lt;/strong>! This means I can make changes and test them much more quickly. Sure, there may be type-related errors in my code, but I will catch them while I debug. It&amp;rsquo;s not ideal, but neither is using typescript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had the same problem using Svelte &amp;ndash; I began to prefer Vue3 because I found my Svelte compile times (even without javascript) were quite slow, sometimes taking 10-15 seconds. Using vue3 with similar projects compiled quickly in under 1 second. I view compile time as a top priority, so it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that I am limited to using certain frameworks because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="typescript-is-currently-a-catch-22">Typescript is currently a catch-22&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The benefit of typescript is a bit of a catch-22. Its purpose is to ensure code quality, and it does that job well in many circumstances. If a project is maintained by a team, its &amp;ldquo;pros&amp;rdquo; can outweigh the &amp;ldquo;cons&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, for independent projects, I believe the cons outweigh the pros. Because, if using typescript slows down development, those type-related bugs could be found with playwright or javascript tests or during local debugging with the time you save waiting for compilation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if typescript slows down developer feedback, it partly defeats the organic developer bug hunt. That&amp;rsquo;s not always the case, but I hope I have made my point that sometimes it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="will-i-use-typescript-more-when-its-faster">Will I use typescript more when it&amp;rsquo;s faster&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final question is why I&amp;rsquo;m personally excited for Typescript 7 with faster compile times. Once compile times have been reduced, it opens my options back up I can use more frameworks if the feedback loop is faster. I would much prefer a type-safe language that needs to be compiled first. My main reservation is the build time. And it looks like Microsoft is preparing to fix that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, yes &amp;ndash; I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to use Typescript 7.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migration experience for vue 2 to vue 3</title><link>/blog/posts/2024/vue_migration/vue_migrtation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/posts/2024/vue_migration/vue_migrtation/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://gportal.link/blog" alt="Featured image of post Migration experience for vue 2 to vue 3" />&lt;p>Disclosure: The words in this post were not AI-generated or altered in any meaningful way. Spell check and other tools were used, but all content and phrases are my own creation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to write about the experience of migrating the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>FileBrowser Quantum&lt;/a> from vue 2 to vue 3 because it took a lot of strategy to do smoothly. I enjoy working with Vue but the experience of moving between versions was quite bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/2689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>original filebrowser application&lt;/a> took almost 1 year to complete the migration and I forked the repo in the middle of the migration before it was finished. In hindsight, I am still glad for this, because it gave me valuable experience in migrating a large Vue application and the opportunity to think about components that were not needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I &lt;a class="link" href="https://gportal.link/blog/posts/2023/october/dependency-on-dependencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wrote about&lt;/a> my ire for unnecessary dependencies which node modules are a big part of. I later &lt;a class="link" href="https://gportal.link/blog/posts/2023/december/process_simplify_modules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wrote about&lt;/a> some things I did to simplify the application so migration could be more easily done. This is the final post I will make about my experience finishing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-it-took-so-long">Why it took so long&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was mostly to blame for the delay. Sure, it took me less time than the original repo, which had one &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/2689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>primary migration PR&lt;/a> which took 8 months to merge! My problem was that I kicked the can down the road and said I would handle it later after a couple of different attempts I made in a day were insufficient. So, I left it alone, until I realized I lost interest in developing the repo because I knew I needed to migrate and that was always in the back of my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/releases/tag/v0.2.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>version v0.2.6&lt;/a> I finally completed the migration!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-i-handled-the-migration">How I handled the migration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my previous posts, I mentioned I would choose a &lt;em>reduction first&lt;/em> strategy. I removed many unnecessary dependencies by replacing them with a few lines of simple code that accomplished the same thing:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, in &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/releases/tag/v0.2.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>version v0.2.6&lt;/a>, I started preparing for the migration:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">6
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">In prep for vue3 migration, npm modules were removed:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">js-base64
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">pretty-bytes
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">whatwg-fetch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">lodash.throttle
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">lodash.clonedeep
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then, in version &lt;code>v0.2.6&lt;/code> I finished the migration:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">removed npm modules:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">vuex
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">noty
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">moment
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">vue-simple-progress
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>In total there were 9 different dependencies were removed. All of which would have complicated the migration if I chose to keep them around. It also helped reduce bundle size, making the site just a little bit quicker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the Vue 3 challenges were quite minimal (besides dependencies). There were a few state-related changes and the switch to vite was the most significant. However, the biggest hurdle (unrelated to vue itself) was that dependencies &lt;strong>had their own dependencies&lt;/strong> that required certain vue versions. Which is, in my opinion, the worst part of a tech stack&amp;hellip; untangling the web of dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="after-the-migration">After the migration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once the migration was complete, I was able to make a lot of great changes very quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s very clear that having a site held back by old versions slowed down my interest in the site and my morale. I learned a lot about what to do and not to do, but overall I feel pretty happy with how it went.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a look at how much faster &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;td>The migration was completed! Yay!&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Aug 3rd  &lt;/td>
&lt;td>v0.2.7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>behavior changes, bugfixes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;td>LOTS&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Oct 7th  &lt;/td>
&lt;td>v0.2.10&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Folder size feature, bugfixes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You can see the pace &lt;strong>clearly&lt;/strong> picked up! In the first half of 2024, I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any significant changes. Once the migration was completed, I was able to work on a lot more things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am glad its all done and looking forward to making some of the more meaningful changes that I have wanted to do for a while.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
