Note: This blog is mainly for development purposes.
## Summary

I have created this blogs website to accomplish a few things:

 1. **Information Sharing**
   - I have always wanted a place to create posts and information for my own purposes, but also for public references (sharing with hyperlinks on websites), but have never had somewhere that was both easy to create and also purely my own creation.
 1. **Developer Creativity**
     - This website allows me to express my interests in certain technologies by posting about my discoveries, how-tos, and analysis.
 1. **Personal Project**
     - I also can experiment and create web-framework related ideas with actual visible usage.

### About the site

This website is actually a **github pages** website, meaning its static content served from my [github blog repo](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/blog). Since this repo is public you can take a look at how it works and maybe find inspiration yourself.

Personally, I think its the perfect solution. I can create posts easily by :

 1. Add a new `md` post, which I have decided to put in a `posts/` directory on github.
 2. Update the `schema.yml` to update the static website to automatically add the page to the html/javascript website (no rebuild needed).
 3. Thats it! A new post!

This is really cool because its on github, which has history and version control, is trustworthy and reliable (it won't suffer outages), and has a free public website functionality via github pages which is basically zero-touch and just works.

However, to add a little color, I don't simply use github pages. I also host my website on https://gportal.link which is a website I have running on [Vultr](vultr.com) for $6 a month which contains an nginx reverse proxy and a few hosted website componets such as a golang authentication server. For my own peace of mind, I keep that repo private :) .

### What about you?

So, perhaps I will allow comments one day, but there's not much interaction yet. Stay tuned!

### Final thoughts

Everything I create is in the spirit of learning the best way to accomplish functionality in the **simplest**, **easiest to maintaintain** manner, while still having broad control. Two of my basic goals for all my development endevors.

For now, however you stumbled across this blog, I hope you learn something new and find it as fun a I do to create.

Here's a snapshot of what the blog looks like right now.. a bit sad. Hopefully better soon:
