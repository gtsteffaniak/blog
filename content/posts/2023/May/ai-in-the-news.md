## Why it matters

I believe AI will disrupt society in exactly the same way other disruptive technologies were in the past. First it will get a lot of attention, before fading into the background of progress. Anyone preaching doom and gloom or "change like never before" are likely misguided or misinformed.

AI is going to be an important part of society - but so was the advent of the telephone, sewer systems, refridgeration, the auto mobile, cement for construction, or the incondecent light bulb. All life changing technologies. So too will AI be life changing.

The debate about whether its ultimately good or bad is unimportant to me. Whether good or bad, we don't know. But we can say its inevitable and will cause sweeping change.
